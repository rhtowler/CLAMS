This file contains notes regarding changes to the database during the Python3/Qt6
version 3 upgrade.


add allowEventChangeWhileProcessing parameter to application_configuration table. This
is a true/false field that determines if a new event can be started when other workstations
are open. MACE runs with this set to True, but the default should be False

gear_accessory_types must be updated to have the parameter_type values. Currently the
parameter_types are for some reason in the description column. The new MACETrawlEvent
form correctly queries the parameter_type column. MACE's database has already been updated.
