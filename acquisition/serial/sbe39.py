"""

sbe39 is a class that provides an interface for interacting with the Sea-Bird SBE-39
bathythermograph. This class provides methods for the most common commands used with
the SBE 39. This class supports the SBE39Plus when it is configured in legacy mode.


Notes:

BINARY DOWNLOADING HAS NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED YET

The connect method will wake the SBE which stops logging (and real-time output) if
the sampling interval is >= 3.

When the SBE's sampling interval is set >= 3 you will see a couple of chars of
gibberish after each line in the real-time output. This comes from the serial
driver in the SBE as it shuts down. You can ignore this.

Also, when the SBE's sampling interval is set >= 3 and you "wake" the device and get the
command prompt, it will not display or record any more data until the SBE times out or is
forced back to sleep.

When issuing the "StartNow" command and interval is set >= 3 the device will start logging
and then go to sleep. If you send any commands to the SBE after issuing "startnow" the
device will be woken up and will not record data until the connection times out.

This class tries to track the connection state (sleep vs awake) and will wake devices it
thinks are sleeping. It will only do this on demand so if you sleep a device (either
explicitly or implicitly) it will stay asleep until you issue another command.

IF YOU HAVE VERY LONG SAMPLING INTERVALS YOU WILL NEED TO MODIFY __maxConAttempts SO THAT
THIS CLASS WILL KEEP TRYING TO WAKE THE DEVICE FOR A PERIOD LONGER THAN THE SAMPLING INTERVAL.
This should be handled better but for now this is how it is.
